\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend algorithms to address multi-physics problems, notably \( H(\text{curl}) \) and \( H(\text{div}) \).
  \item Validate the efficacy of our algorithms in real-world scenarios such as Magnetotellurics, Controlled Sources, and Logging While Drilling.
  \item Analyze the impact of the nature and distribution of various random samples on DL inversion for optimization.
  \item Enhance parallelization and factorization techniques to reduce computational resource requirements in future applications.
