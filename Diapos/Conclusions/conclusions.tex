\begin{itemize}
\item Deep Learning (DL) is an adequate option to invert borehole resistivity measurements in real time.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item We need efficient DL solvers of PDEs to create the databased for the Neural Network training.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item New challenges arise when solving PDEs using DL due to quadrature errors.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item Selecting an adequate quadrature strategy is critical. We propose adaptive integration for low dimensions.
\end{itemize}
