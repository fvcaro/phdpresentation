\begin{itemize}
\item We have employed hierarchical basis functions that effectively address the challenge of \emph{hanging nodes}.
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item We have developed \textbf{simple-to-implement} \( h \)- and \( p \)-GOA strategies that use an unconventional symmetric and positive definite bilinear form for possibly non-elliptic goal-oriented problems.
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item We have expanded upon a painless automatic \( hp \) strategy, initially developed for energy-norm adaptivity, to both non-elliptic and goal-oriented problems.
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item We have extended the applicability of a coarsening strategy to encompass parametric PDEs.
